File modified: D:\B5\index.html
Summary of work done:
- Rebuilt the HTML from scratch.
- Kept the Avenir font and specific dark brand colors (dark, green, sage, gold, beige).
- Changed the bento layout entirely to a premium, smooth-scroll minimalist layout (GSAP). 
- Located "b.png" and "billy.jpg" and copied them to the D:\B5 folder.
- Replaced the top circular hero image with "b.png" as requested in the audio.
- Added a new custom "Connection" module near the bottom featuring "billy.jpg" marked as "Connected".

If the Antigravity UI interface crashes or reloads, all your files are physically saved on your D:\ drive inside D:\B5. The code is safe locally.
